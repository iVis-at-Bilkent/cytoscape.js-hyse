# cytoscape-hyse

## Description

HySE (**Hy**brid **S**pring **E**mbedder), is a layout algorithm designed for laying out hybrid graph with a central directed part and connected undirected parts (e.g., a hybrid UML diagram where the class inheritance hierarchy forms the directed part and other types of associations form the remaining undirected parts of the diagram). The algorithm uses a wholist spring embedder where as crossing minimization and final positioning of the hierarchy is polished, the undirected part is also beautified simultaneously.
